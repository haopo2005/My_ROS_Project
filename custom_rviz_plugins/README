The ros_pub_video will publish two kinds of topics.
One is sensor_msgs/Image
The other is self-defined messages contains only one value, "score"

The rviz_plugin will receive the above topics and render the image.
If the score is smaller than 0.5, then it will print "IDIOT" over the image layer.
If the score is greater than 0.5, then it will print "GENIUS" over the image layer.

Don't want to offend anyone. Just demo video.
